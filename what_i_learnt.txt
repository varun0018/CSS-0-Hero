selectors

ways to grab and manipulate html elements using css

three selectors

1)element selector

selectors element with inbult tags
like <p> body etc

applies to all the element with that tag on the page

ranks bottom of specificity rate
less importance is given when compared to classes and id's

2)class selector

selects elements wiht a certain class name

unlike id's can be used multiple times two or more classes can 
be combined
. symbol is used to target specific class

3)id selector

selectors elements with a certain id name

cannot have multiple html elements with same id name

an html file can have one id repeated only once

# symbol is used to target specific id

Specificity Hierarchy

1)Inline styles
2)IDs
3)Classes attributes and pseudo classes(:hover,:focus)
4)Elements and pseudo-elments such as h1,div

How to Calculate Specificity

1)start at 0
2)1000 for style attributes
3)100 for IDs
4)10 for classes
4)1 for html element

for same specificity latest rule is applied

sudo selectors

they are used when we want to add some features for html elements

:hover->changes state when we hover over element

we can use child to selector to select a particular child of parenet
for eg in ul 

li:first-child//selectors first child
li:last-child//selects last child
li:nth-child(n)//n can be changed to select a child


use :visited to to change the appearence of of visited link

adv select

we can select ele after a selector and apply style
like this 
h2 + a //here we are basically saying for every a tag after h2

-------------------------------------------------------

background

very useful can be used to apply any of background properties
using this one property(background)

change background imaage using
background:url("image location")
background-size can be used to change the size of background image
contain and cover are imp ones

opacity

changes the visiblity of the background image
its value ranges from 0-1
1->being complety transparent
0->being invisible

change opacity of img by adding a to rgb ie 
rgb()->rgba()
a->alpha or transparency

gradients

gradients can be used to make color fade by mixing in multiple colors
background:linear-gradient(to right,colors)
to right can be changed to direction we want the color to fade
to right->from left to right
to bottom right->top left to bottom right

radial-gradient can be used to make kinda circle or spiral

Types of units in css

1)absolute units->cm,inch,px

2)relative units->%,em more useful for resposive website

%->covers that percent of size of the parent ele
em->inheried gets added to the size of parent size
em of parent+em of the child ele gets applied to child

vh->1% of total body height
vh takes view port into consideration

vw->1% of total body height

relative units are beteer offf in resposive web dev
